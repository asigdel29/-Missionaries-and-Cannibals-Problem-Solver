The Problem
Three missionaries and three cannibals, along with one boat that fits at most two people (and
requires at least one person for operation), are on the left bank of a river. The most salient thing
about missionaries and cannibals in “cohabitation” is that if ever the cannibals in any one spot (left
bank, right bank, on the boat) outnumber the missionaries, the outnumbered missionaries will be
consumed – eaten! The goal of this problem is to get all six individuals safely across the river from
the left bank to the right bank.
